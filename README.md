# spaceNtime
Welcome! This package contains the code to create encounter histories for and run Space-to-Event and Instantaneous Sampling analyses described in ["Three novel methods to estimate abundance of unmarked animals using remote cameras" by Moeller et al. (2018)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2331).

This is my first package and is very much in development, so it is frequently changing. I would appreciate hearing from you if you encounter problems! Please check back frequently, because I will be actively adding new features. 

## Getting started 
Please try installing the package and viewing the vignette.

1. Update to the newest version of R

2. run `devtools::install_github("annam21/spaceNtime", force = T, build_vignettes = T)`

3. run `browseVignettes("spaceNtime")` Then click on HTML. 

Note: RStudio 1.3.159 does not respond to this command. If nothing happens, try running the command in R rather than RStudio.

4. Also see `??spaceNtime` for additional resources.
