# spaceNtime

## Welcome 
This package contains the code to create encounter histories for and run Space-to-Event and Instantaneous Sampling analyses described in ["Three novel methods to estimate abundance of unmarked animals using remote cameras" by Moeller et al. (2018)](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.2331).

This is my first package and is frequently changing. I would appreciate hearing from you if you encounter problems. Please check back frequently, because I will be actively adding new features. 

## Practical guide
See our publication [spaceNtime: an R package for estimating abundance of unmarked
animals using cameraâ€‘trap photographs](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42991-021-00181-8) to learn more about designing and running these analyses.

## Getting started on analysis
Please try installing the package and viewing the vignette.

1. Update to the newest version of R

2. run `devtools::install_github("annam21/spaceNtime", force = T, build_vignettes = T)`

3. run `browseVignettes("spaceNtime")` Then click on HTML. 

4. Also see `??spaceNtime` for additional resources.
